# Analysis
To calculate number of hawkers in SWCDC, a region in Singapore.

# Signature
## Why does this exist?
I spent hours wrangling with gmail *signatures* of all things. Too fed up with the limited possibilities inside gmail, I decided to code my own.

## How to use the files in 'signature'
1. Open the file as a normal html file in a browser to see how it looks like (or use something like [html-online](https://html-online.com/editor/))
2. Skip step 1, start editing straight away.
3. Copy and paste the WYSIWYG output into gmail.

([This guy](https://github.com/skarif2/gmail-signature) explains it much better.)

## Other better editors
For future reference.
